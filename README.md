 ## Reflection
 ### Tech Stack
 ```
 HTML
 Vanilla CSS
 JavaScript
 ```
 ### Key Learnings
 ```
 1) Identifying ways to pass data into
    and out of event listeners. 
 2) Exposure to and implementation 
    of object constructors.
 3) Importance of replicating a problem
    and searching for a solution via
    external resources/pseudocode.
 4) Incorporating comments to outline
    a function defintion's purpose or
    an html element's styling.
 5) Learning how scoping rules apply
    especially in the context of
    event listeners, function definitons,
    anonymous functions, and object
    constructors. 
 6) Being cognizant of scoping rules 
    reduced a lot of headache and pain.
